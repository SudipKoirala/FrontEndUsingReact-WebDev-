      <h2>Cat Nutrition & Diet Guide</h2>
      <p>Providing a balanced diet is essential for your cat's **health, energy levels, and longevity**. Cats are **obligate carnivores**, meaning they require **animal-based proteins** to thrive.</p>

      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h3>üï∞Ô∏è Feeding Schedule</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kittens (Up to 6 months):</strong> 3-4 small meals per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Adults (1-7 years):</strong> 2 meals per day.</li>
